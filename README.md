# fib-and-memoization
A fibonacci sequence program made using PyQt5
This program will take an input of n (where n is a number) and return the nth value in the fibonacci sequence as well as the time taken to run the program as both the standard fibonacci sequence and as a fibonacci memoization sequence.  
If the standard fibonacci sequence takes too long to find the nth value an error message will appear since it took too long.
